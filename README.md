# Personal Trainer - Fitness App

This is an Android (Java) project of a fitness application called *Personal Trainer* developed for the class Mobile Applications at the University of Applied Sciences HTWG Konstanz.

## Features

This fitness app acts like a personal trainer supporting individual training. The app can be used by any athlete. However, the target group is not only advanced athletes, but also beginners who would like to do something for their health and need support to get started.

Since the app serves as a training support, you can set clear targets and goals with the training plans and always motivate yourself further by viewing the results and successes of the training in the statistics after you have entered them after each training day. In addition, you can see the correct execution of the exercise directly in the app, so that incorrect executions and resulting health complications are avoided.

Beginners benefit especially from the pre-built training plans if they cannot yet accurately assess their athletic and physical limits. Advanced users, on the other hand, benefit from the option of creating their own individual training plan.
